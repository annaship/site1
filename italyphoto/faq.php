      <p>All registered participants will receive our <span id="inner_em">Venetian Light&nbsp;&amp;
      Life</span> orientation booklet with
detailed instructions on how to get to your hotel in Venice, what to bring in terms of photographic
equipment and clothing, and more information about how the workshop is structured. Our booklet is
also teeming with good ideas about where to find the best cappuccino and gelato, what books about
Venice you can read before you come, how to politely ask a stranger if you can photograph her or
him, and Holly&#39;s prized and closely&nbsp;&mdash; guarded Venice restaurant
list.</p>

      <div id="title2"><a name="getting">Getting to Venice</a>
      </div>

      <div id="title3">
        What is the best way to get to Venice from the U.S.?
      </div>
      <p>Venice is easily reached by air, by train, or by car. We&#39;ll get you exact instructions
about how to reach Venice and the Don Orione (and the Pensione Accademia&#47;Villa Maravege) in our
Venice orientation booklet after you register, but here&#39;s a start.
</p>
      <p>If you come by air to Venice&#39;s Marco Polo airport, the easiest way to get to the Don Orione
        is via the <span id="inner_em">Alilaguna</span> boat. Check out <a HREF="http://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/venice_airport_boat.htm">this website</a> for more information.
You&#39;ll want the <span id="inner_em">Linea Rossa</span>,
or Red Line. This will take you right to the quay on the Zattere in front of the Don Orione.
The Pensione Accademia&#47;Villa Maravege is a 10 minute walk from where you disembark from the
Alilaguna Red Line boat. Coming by train, you&#39;ll arrive at the Santa Lucia station. To reach both
the Don Orione&nbsp;&amp; the Pensione Accademia&#47;Villa Maravege you&#39;ll want to take the #2 vaporetto&nbsp;&mdash; in the
direction of the Lido&nbsp;&mdash; to the Accademia stop. If you plan to arrive in Venice by car, you should
check out the many choices at <a HREF="http://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/arriving_in_venice_by_car.htm">this useful website</a>.</p>

      <div id="title3">
        Can I arrive in Venice a day or so early?
      </div>
      <p>It is an excellent idea to arrive in Europe a few days before the workshop begins to get
over jet lag. But there are no available rooms at either the Don Orione or the The Pensione
Accademia&#47;Villa Maravege, (they were already fully booked a year in advance), so you will need to
find your own lodgings.</p>

      <div id="title2">
        <a name="living">Living in Dorsoduro</a>
      </div>

      <div id="title3">
        What weather can I expect in September?
      </div>
      <p>In September the weather in Venice is very pleasant: daytime temperatures on average are in
the low-to-mid 70&#39;s, and there are an average of 7 hours of sunshine a day. Night temperatures are
in the high 50&#39;s to low 60&#39;s. Rain is always
possible.</p>

      <div id="title3">
        Where will the workshop take place in Venice?
      </div>
      
      <p>The <a HREF="http://www.donorione-venezia.it/ing/home.htm">Centro Culturale Don Orione</a> is a Renaissance ex-monastery with 4 inner courtyards and
very modern additions and amenities, including our classroom. The Don Orione is located on the
Zattere, Venice&#39;s lovely embankment along the Giudecca Canal. The renowned <a HREF="http://www.pensioneaccademia.it/">Pensione Accademia&#47;Villa
Maravege</a> is on the quiet San Trovaso canal, within two beautiful gardens. Both are 3-star hotels
with air-conditioning, wi-fi, and full
breakfasts.</p>

      <div id="title3">How can we get around in Venice?
      </div>
      <p>Every part of Venice is reachable by <a HREF="http://www.venice.nu/maps/vaporetto-map/"><span id="inner_em">vaporetto</span>, Venice&#39;s water bus system</a>. Vaporetto boat
stops are right near the Don Orione on the Giudecca Canal. Boats for most lines come every 10
minutes. We will give you a pass for 12 days of free vaporetto rides that will give you access to
all of Venice and to islands in the Venetian Lagoon. Venetians prefer to walk everywhere, and
walking is often the fastest way to reach a destination. Henry James once said that he hoped he
would never lose his ability to get lost wandering in Venice. We recommend that you practice this
art (and bring your
camera).</p>

      <div id="title3">What&#39;s the best way to get Euros?
      </div>

      <p>Venice has many ATM machines, called <span id="inner_em">Bancomats</span>. Moreover you can pay for almost everything
        with credit cards. Check out this website for advice
        on <a HREF="http://www.reidsguides.com/italy/planning/money/changing_money.html">exchanging dollars for
Euros</a>.</p>

      <div id="title3">Are Venice restaurants expensive?
      </div>
      <p>Sure, the most famous restaurants are expensive, but Venice also has many excellent and
        reasonably priced restaurants and osterias. We will tell you about these in our <span id="inner_em">Venetian Light&nbsp;&amp;
      Life</span> booklet.
      </p>

      <div id="title3">What are the alternatives to eating in a restaurant?
      </div>
      <p>The Don Orione shares the lovely Zattere embankment with <span id="inner_em">Billa</span>, Venice&#39;s largest
      supermarket, where you can get delicious breads, cheeses, salamis, fruits and take-out dishes that
      you can eat on the Zattere or in one of the Don&#39;s courtyards. The colorful Rialto market is not only
      a great place to buy food, but a delicious place to
      photograph.</p>

      <div id="title3">I&#39;ve heard that Venice is overrun with tourists&nbsp;&amp; that the canals stink.
      True?
      </div>
      <p>There are always many visitors in Venice, especially during the Biennale exhibition,
      because Venice is so extraordinarily beautiful. Visit the Basilica and the Piazza San Marco and go
      with the flow. But Venice is Holly&#39;s second home, and she leads us to special places she knows that
      Venetians cherish and the outside world doesn&#39;t know about. As for the canals, Venice&#39;s dynamic
      philosophy professor Mayor, Massimo Cacciari, had the canals (as well as the city government)
      dredged and cleaned and septic systems installed. Venice is sweet
      again.</p>

      <div id="title3">How does one dress in Venice?
      </div>
      <p>Venice is a cosmopolitan city and you will find all kinds of clothing styles. First and
      foremost, dress for comfort and wear comfortable shoes! In our orientation booklet we&#39;ll give you
      much more fashion advice, including what to wear if you get invited to a Biennale party in the
      Palazzo
      Papadopoli.</p>

      <div id="title3">Will we be able to do laundry?
      </div>
      <p>There is a modern coin-operated Laundromat on the Giudecca island, an easy boat-ride away
      from the Don Orione.
      </p>

      <div id="title3">How safe is it to wander the streets and photograph at all hours?
      </div>
      <p>Venice is perhaps the safest city in Europe, for the simple reason that there are no
      getaway cars or motorcycles. The quality of light at night and at dawn are exhilarating times to
      photograph in Venice. Using good sense, you can wander and photograph at night without
      fear.</p>

      <div id="title3">Are the Don Orione rooms quiet?
      </div>
      <p>Yes. Venice is amazingly quiet at night. The Don Orione is a completely modernized
      Renaissance monastery with thick walls and modern windows and climate controls. The Pensione
      Accademia&#47;Villa Maravege is equally well built, and it is on a quiet canal. It contains two
      beautiful private gardens. There is however always the danger that you might be woken up at night by
      a gondolier singing &#8220;Nessun
      dorma&#8221;.</p>

      <div id="title3">Can I get a single room?
      </div>
      <p>Yes, you can have a single if you register early enough, as we have a limited number of
      singles. For lodging choices and prices, visit the <a HREF="registration.php">Registration</a>
      page.</p>

      <div id="title3">Can I bring a friend or family member who will not be in the workshop?
      </div>
      <p>Yes, workshop guests are welcome to join us. A companion fee of $2,850 includes double
      occupancy lodging at the Don Orione, breakfasts, all group meals, and field trips. For guest fees
      for the Pensione Accademia&#47;Villa Maravege, check out our registration page. Please note: If you are
      interested in one of our 4 lodging alternatives to sharing a double room at the Don Orione, you must
      contact Holly for rate information&nbsp;&amp; room
      availability!</p>

      <div id="title3">If I am coming alone but want to share a room, how do I get a roommate?
      </div>
      <p>We do an excellent job of pairing roommates, and many participants form long-lasting
      friendships with those with whom they have shared the experience of rooming together in Venice.
      </p>

      <div id="title3">How about electricity and internet access?
      </div>
      <p>Each bedroom has a number of electrical wall outlets, as well as a private bathroom with a
      hair dryer. Electricity in Europe comes out of wall sockets at 220 volts alternating at 50 cycles
      per second, and this would fry a device like an electric shaver or a clothes iron made for sole use
      in the US. Electricity in the US comes out at 110 volts, alternating at 60 cycles per second.
      However, most digital devices are constructed for use in both the US and Europe, so for these you
      will need only a simple 110&#8211;220 plug adapter for each laptop and external hard drive power cord. Our
      classroom is equipped with 220 extension cords and power strips. Free wireless internet is available
      at both hotels, including our classroom at the
      Don.</p>

        <a name="workshop">Enjoying the Workshop</a>
      </div>

      <div id="title3">What photographic&nbsp;&amp; computer equipment&nbsp;&amp; clothing should I bring?
      </div>
      <p>Our orientation booklet will give you a complete list of essential equipment and
      recommended accessories to bring to Venice. It will also include useful tips about clothing, shoes,
      etc. The bottom line is that you will need to bring a digital camera that shoots in the raw format
      and a laptop computer with Lightroom&nbsp;3 installed (the free 30-day trial will work well). If you&#39;ve
      registered for the workshop&nbsp;&amp; would like some advice about what cameras, laptop, tripod, lenses,
      etc. to buy, <a HREF="mailto:hollysmithpedlosky@italyphotoworkshops.org">email Holly</a>.</p>

      <div id="title3">I&#39;m a working professional who has been shooting digitally for years. Will
      this workshop be too elementary for me?
      </div>

      <p>No way. Lightroom&nbsp;3 is a cutting-edge application, and George Jardine is the acknowledged
      master of teaching it. George&#39;s sessions will reward participants at all levels.
      </p>
      <p>We guarantee that we, with the help of Venetian light and life, will offer inspiration,
      challenges, substantive critiques, and incredible learning experiences. In addition, participants
      learn an enormous amount from each other. Every professional who has participated in this workshop
      has told us that their vision and the quality of their work has deepened significantly because of
      it. Be sure to read some of the participant evaluations located
      <a href="testimonials.php">here</a>.</p>
      
      <div id="title3">I&#39;ve worked with a digital camera and computer for over a year, but I&#39;m still scared of the
      technology. Will I be up to the level of the rest of the participants?
      </div>
      <p>You couldn&#39;t have chosen a better workshop. We are very patient, experienced instructors
      with years of photo experience with both film and digital media. We are skilled at leading new
      photographers, as well as experienced pros, to new levels of mastery. We will also offer optional
      sessions geared to those with different levels of
      experience.</p>
      <p>Through years of giving these workshops, we know that once you master basic techniques and
      learn new ways of seeing, new photographers can make images as powerful as those made by more
      experienced image
      makers.</p>

      <div id="title3">I&#39;m a PC user. Will I feel welcome?
      </div>
      <p>Absolutely. Adobe Photoshop Lightroom is cross-platform. Our faculty and staff will help
      you work with your images with Lightroom&nbsp;3 on your own
      computer.</p>

      <div id="title3">What is the schedule like?
      </div>
      <p>We&#39;ll usually meet in the classroom from 10am&#8211;1pm. Then we&#39;ll take a Mediterranean lunch
      break for a few hours (we&#39;ll pass on useful information about how to find everything from a market
      to buy marvelous fruit, cheeses, and breads to a great <span id="inner_em">spaghetti alla scogliera</span>). Then we will meet
      most afternoons for critiques and field
      trips.</p>
      <p>You will have lots of free time each day when the light is perfect for shooting, as well as
      a full free day to do with what you will. Our class field trips (guests are welcome) will take us to
      a particular island or neighborhood, but once there you can choose to explore on your
      own.</p>
      <p>The schedule builds in time for optional smaller group sessions that teach techniques
      geared to different experience levels. The instructors give out assignments, and everyone
      participates in group critiques. On the last full day, photographers give a final presentation on a
      theme, chosen by you with our coaching, inspired by the light and life of
      Venice.</p>
      <p>After you register, we&#39;ll send you our orientation booklet with much more information about
      the schedule so that you can enjoy Venice and the workshop to the
      fullest.</p>

      <div id="title3">Can I bring a film camera?
      </div>
      <p>You can bring a shoe-box pinhole or a Polaroid 20&times;24&#8221; camera if you like, but the
      instruction will be about digital photography. You&#39;ll discover what a splendid tool a digital camera
      is for connecting with Italians. Digital shooting with its immediate feedback generates a free flow
      of ideas and a different kind of interaction between photographer&nbsp;&amp; subject, especially in Italy.
      We&#39;ll teach you the Italian phrases you need to make new friends. Your photographic ideas will come
      to life as you
      shoot.</p>

      <p id="inner_em">Participant opinion is very important to us and we&#39;re proud of the accolades we have
        received through the years. Please visit our <a HREF="testimonials.php">testimonials</a> page for a summary of student
