          Holly Smith Pedlosky is an artist-photographer who spends part of every
          year in Venice. Holly&#39;s career began with shooting black and white
          film using large-format cameras, but when she spent two years living,
          teaching, and photographing in Venice, she fell in love with Venetian
          light and color, and she began to shoot color slides. She now
          embraces digital shooting and printing as a liberation. Holly
          graduated from Harvard University and holds Master&#39;s degrees from
          the University of Colorado and the School of the Art Institute of
          Chicago. She has taught at Radcliffe Seminars at Harvard University
          and at Lesley Seminars. She co-founded and taught at Northeastern
          University&#39;s digital photography program in Venice, Italy. She has
          an international exhibition record, with work in many collections.
          Currently, she explores Italian spaces through panoramic images, and
          she documents the disappearing art of hanging laundry in Venice,
          Italy and the women whose art it is to hang it. Holly speaks Italian
          and teaches in Italy for ICP on both Lake Como and in Venice. Visit
