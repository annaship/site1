        <p>Many participants return to Holly&#39;s Italian workshops a second or third (even
        a fifth!) time. We take our evaluations seriously and appreciate the great ideas
        offered by the talented photographers who have joined us through the years. Our
        goal is for you to have a terrific time and to learn a lot about photography and
        Italy.</p>
        <p>Below are some samples of recent evaluations submitted anonymously by
        workshop participants in Holly&#39;s Italian photography workshops on Lake Como and
        in Venice for International Center of Photography.</p>

        <div id="title2">
          What did you like best about this workshop?
        </div>
        <p>&#8220;Everything!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;First of all the workshop was extraordinary&nbsp;&mdash; the breadth of material
        covered was remarkable&nbsp;&mdash; although I have considerable photographic experience, I
        learned something new everyday.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I loved every minute of this workshop. As a first-time photography
        student and DSLR user, every bit of information was invaluable. I would do it
        again in a heartbeat.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The instruction. The people. The enthusiasm. And complete access to
        the instructors&#8230; and the complete bliss of Italy. Much fun!!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Three things: I learned a lot; I got professional feedback on my work;
        and the setting was dreamlike in its beauty. The whole experience of this
        workshop was exciting and pleasurable beyond my expectations&nbsp;&mdash; which were
        considerable to begin with.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The patience and attention of the faculty, the well planned program
        and the amount of information covered in such a short time span.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Simply extraordinary! Excellent progression of skills & technique.
        Very comprehensive. The instructors were very helpful and also a lot of fun.
        Learned a lot&nbsp;&mdash; very supportive.&#8220;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I was extremely happy with the diverse instructors. I&#39;ve never
        experienced that anywhere. I loved the individual assignments.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Receiving a group critique was unnerving and yet so incredibly
        helpful. Where else can you get such focused, non-biased input?
        Amazing.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I am glad there was room in this workshop for people of such diverse
        backgrounds. I loved getting professional feedback and I enjoyed the wide range
        of ages in the group.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The location is incredible.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I can&#39;t emphasize enough how much I got out of this
        workshop.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The workshop instruction staff is top notch.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The viewpoints and knowledge of all three [faculty members]
        complemented each other beautifully, and enriched our learning.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I enjoyed the serious and companionable photographers.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;We really did get to explore a beautiful, visually inspiring place far
        from home.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Holly created a supportive and inspiring atmosphere.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I loved the split of time between field trips and classroom
        work.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The diversity of staff and students.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The setting, enthusiasm of participants, the expertise of the
        staff.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I loved the day trips.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I also learned a great deal from some of my fellow
        students.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The varied places that Holly took us to were all fascinating and fun
        to photograph.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Holly&#39;s leadership was a delight. This is a must do life experience
        and I&#39;m so glad I did it. I loved it all.&#8221;</p>

        <div id="title2">
          How well organized was this workshop?
        </div>

        <p>&#8220;Extremely well.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;The instructor provided excellent advance information, written
        workflows, stimulating excursions, and a very enjoyable dinner finale. I have
        art direction experience and I could see someone put a lot of thought and
        attention to detail into this effort.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Good balance of lectures, hands-on equipment training, and time for
        shooting.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I loved the mix of class time and excursions. I really feel I
        accomplished so much in just ten days. I want to come back. I can&#39;t believe how
        energetic I feel.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Like they&#39;ve been doing it for years with great success.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Very well organized!&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Well organized and ever changing&nbsp;&mdash; as should be&nbsp;&mdash; according to the weather
        and needs of the participants.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;We never had to wait for the instructors. Every time I came to class
        early to use the internet, the instructors were already there.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Each class session and every assignment contributed to student
          progress. If it rained, there was always a Plan&nbsp;B. But most people loved
        shooting in the rain anyway. The wet colors were so intense.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;I appreciated the itinerary schedule printouts, the workflow PDFs, and
        the visual introductions to various techniques.&#8221;</p>
        <p>&#8220;Even though the photographic and computer literacy levels among the
        students varied, Holly and her team kept everyone together. I was
        impressed.&#8221;</p>
