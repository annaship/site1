      <p><span id="title3">Venetian Light&nbsp;&amp; Life: From Within</span> is
      a digital photography workshop in Venice with Italy Photography Workshops Founder and Director
      <a href="instructors.php">Holly Smith Pedlosky</a> and Special Guest Instructor and
      master educator <a href="instructors.php#jardine">George Jardine</a>. </p>

      <p>George Jardine, a former Adobe Pro Photography Evangelist and member of the
      original Lightroom development team, will teach Adobe Lightroom&nbsp;3.
      Participants shoot camera raw files and learn Lightroom&#39;s extensive
      capabilities for editing, organizing, and optimizing their images.
      Holly speaks Italian and lives in Venice for part of every year, and
      she and George will lead photographers to explore and photograph a
      mysterious hidden Venice and show them how to master techniques and
      develop their potential to the fullest. All levels of experience* are
      welcome.</p>

      <p>A goal of our workshop is to coach you as you learn this liberating new
      digital workflow. Holly and George teach both technique and artistic
      vision in sessions that include demonstrations, assignments, and
      critiques, all geared to the skill level of each photographer. There
      will be field trips and optional sessions on special photographic
      topics. In addition photographers will have individual time with the
      instructors.</p>

      <p>Venetian light&nbsp;&amp; Life: From Within
      offers you a Venice that you could not find on your own or with any
      other group. We will enable you to experience the sweetness of life
      in this lovely city that for a thousand years has been called La
      Serenissima.</p>

      <p>On field trip adventures, we explore an ancient city that is still very
      vibrant in the present, where 1,500 years of human stories speak to
      you from every campo. Venice is made up of 150 little islands
      surrounded by the Venetian Lagoon, all bathed in a luminous golden
      light. Participants visit secret gardens, a fishing village where
      houses are painted with vibrant colors, taste the delights of
      Venetian cuisine and drinks, and meet authentic Venetians who still
      speak the Venetian dialect. Photographers and their guests partake of
      a welcoming pizza dinner the first night, feast at the outstanding
      Trattoria Gatto Nero da Ruggero
      on the island of Burano, and enjoy a Venetian banquet on the last
      night.</p>

      <p>You will have plenty of free time to explore Venice, one of the most
      beautiful cities in the world. The prestigious international art
      exhibition The Venice Biennale 2011, a short boat ride away, turns
      the city into an exhilarating pendulum between what is modern and
      ancient, serene and charged, real and dream-like. In Biennale years,
      there are art exhibits and performances throughout the city in
      palaces and churches normally closed to the public. Music envelops
      you in the form of a street musician who plays on glass goblets, the
      romantic violins of an evening on the Piazza San Marco, a concert in
      an old palazzo, or songs of love and sorrow coming from a passing
      gondola.</p>

      <p>At the end of 12 days of being in Venice, you will find that you, too,
      have a new address.
      </p>

      <p>Our base in Venice is the <a href="http://www.donorione-venezia.it/ing/home.htm">Don Orione</a>,
